# Cylinder_volume

The formaula for the volume of a cylinder is:
(area of the circle base) x height of the cylinder = (𝜋r^2) x h

The user will be asked to type in 2 float(or int converted to float) values separately, the circle base's diameter and the cylinder's height.

Then the area of the circle base will be calculated first, followed by the cylinder's volume.

Since the diameter of a circle is twice the size of its radius, and the area formula uses the radius, the answered given by the formula has to be divided by 4.
- This is because (r)^2 would become (1/2 * d)^2 = 1/4(d)^2

The answers given by the area and volume formulae are rounded to 2 decimal places.
